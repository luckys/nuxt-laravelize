## Package-specific usage

The package exposes a small, explicit surface. Configure its dependencies from an application provider or adapter and test its boundaries before promoting it to production.

## Public entrypoints

Use only these public entrypoints. Paths not listed here are internals and may change without notice.

| Entrypoint | Use |
|---|---|
| `package root` | Public entrypoint for this package. |
| `./runtime` | Public entrypoint for this package. |

## Queued event listeners

`@nuxt-laravelize/events-queue` connects listeners marked with `shouldQueue: true` to a queue without coupling the base packages.

```bash
pnpm add @nuxt-laravelize/events @nuxt-laravelize/queue @nuxt-laravelize/events-queue
```

```ts
class WelcomeUserListener implements Listener<UserRegistered> {
  readonly shouldQueue = true as const
  async handle(event: UserRegistered) { /* send welcome message */ }
}

events.listen(UserRegistered, welcomeUserListenerToken)
await events.dispatch(new UserRegistered('user_1'))
```

| API | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `EventRegistry.register()` | Registers serializable event constructors by name. The adapter calls it automatically. |
| `EventRegistry.make(name, args)` | Recreates a registered event from constructor arguments. |
| `QueueListenerAdapter.enqueue()` | Enqueues events that implement `toPayload()` as a `ListenerJob`; returns `false` for other events. |
| `ListenerJob` | Resolves and runs the original listener inside the queue worker. |
| `eventRegistryToken` | Resolves the shared registry. |

## Compatibility and boundaries

Respect the at-least-once delivery, durability, authorization, tenant isolation, and secret-handling warnings in the reference section. Examples do not replace server-side authentication, authorization, or validation.

The shared API and security reference lives in the [module guide](../../docs/modules.md#queued-event-listeners). This page summarizes this package's contract and keeps copy-pasteable examples.
